# NetLogo Social Media Influence Simulation - Implementation Plan

## 1. Initial Setup Phase

### Agent and Media Setup
- Create breeds for agents (users) and media profiles
- Set up the small-world network using `nw:generate-watts-strogatz` extension
- Initialize agent attributes:
  - Political views (left/right/undecided) using different colors
  - Susceptibility to change (random within defined range)
  - Fatigue level (starting at 0)
- Create media nodes with attributes:
  - Type (propaganda-left, propaganda-right, neutral)
  - Reach and effectiveness values

### Network Structure Implementation
- Implement local connections between agents
- Add random long-distance connections for authority/influencer simulation
- Set up link weights representing influence strength
- Visualize the network with appropriate colors and shapes
- Add monitors to track network metrics

## 2. Core Behavior Rules Implementation

### Opinion Change Mechanics
- Create procedures for:
  - Opinion change based on neighbors' influence
  - Response to propaganda content
  - Response to neutral content
  - Fatigue accumulation over time
- Implement weighted influence calculations
- Add behavioral switches for testing different scenarios

## 3. External Factors Integration

### Environment Variables
- Create sliders/inputs for:
  - Economic factors (unemployment, inflation)
  - Event occurrence probability
  - Event impact strength
- Implement event triggering system
- Add procedures for temporary changes in agent susceptibility

## 4. Data Collection and Analysis

### Metrics and Reporting
- Set up BehaviorSpace experiments
- Create reporters for:
  - Political view distribution
  - Opinion stability metrics
  - Polarization index calculation
  - Event impact analysis
- Implement data export functionality

## 5. Implementation Order

1. Test basic network generation and visualization
2. Implement and test basic opinion change mechanics
3. Add media influence logic
4. Implement fatigue system
5. Add external events system
6. Implement data collection
7. Fine-tune parameters and test different scenarios

## 6. Interface Elements

### Required Controls
- Sliders:
  - Number of agents
  - Number of media nodes
  - Network parameters (connections, rewiring probability)
  - Influence strength parameters
- Switches:
  - Enable/disable different influence types
  - Toggle external events
- Plots:
  - Population distribution over time
  - Polarization index
  - Fatigue levels
- Monitors:
  - Current distribution of views
  - Network metrics
  - Event status

## 7. Testing Plan

### Verification Steps
1. Test each mechanism separately
2. Verify network structure metrics
3. Run sensitivity analysis on key parameters
4. Test different initial conditions
5. Validate against expected behavior

### Key Aspects to Test
- Network generation correctness
- Opinion change dynamics
- Media influence effectiveness
- Fatigue system impact
- External events influence
- Data collection accuracy
