# Parallel Partition Counter Implementation Plan

## 1. Understand the Sequential Algorithm
- Analyze the existing `countPartitions` method
- The method recursively counts partitions by:
  1. Base cases: n <= 1 or m == 1 returns 1
  2. For each k from min(n,m) down to 1:
     - Recursively count partitions of (n-k) with max component k
     - Sum all possibilities

## 2. Parallelization Strategy
- Use ForkJoinPool and RecursiveTask for parallel execution
- Key considerations:
  - Task granularity: n * m determines when to split
  - Parallel decomposition:
    - Split the for loop into parallel subtasks
    - Each subtask handles a range of k values
  - Sequential threshold:
    - When n * m < threshold, execute sequentially
    - Suggested initial threshold: 1000 (can be tuned)

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 3.1: Modify Task Class
- Add threshold as class field
- Implement compute() method:
  - Check if should execute sequentially
  - If parallel:
    - Split k range into subtasks
    - Fork subtasks
    - Join and sum results

### Step 3.2: Add Sequential Helper
- Move existing countPartitions to Task class
- Use as sequential fallback

### Step 3.3: Tuning
- Experiment with threshold values
- Measure performance on different inputs
- Optimize task splitting strategy

## 4. Testing Plan
- Test edge cases:
  - n = 0, 1
  - m = 1
  - n = m
- Verify parallel results match sequential
- Measure speedup on large inputs (n > 100)

## 5. Documentation
- Add comments explaining parallel strategy
- Document threshold choice
- Include performance measurements
